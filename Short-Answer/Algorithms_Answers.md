### I gave 2 answers along with why.


## a) 
   1. 0(n^3) - because of the n * n * n in while loop 
   
   2.  0(n) -  the loop is only running linear based on n. if n == 1 it while run 1 time n == 2 twice etc..


## b)
   1. 0(n^4) - 4 nested for loops. O(n) _ O(n) _ O(n) * O(n) = O(n^4)
   2. 0(n^3) - all will run linear except for the last which will always run 10 times. 
## c)
   1. 0(n) This is a recursive function that is just running like a loop. Its going to start at whatever value bunnies is until its -1 so its linear 0(n)
